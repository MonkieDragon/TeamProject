# HEX RUN

![hex image](./assets/Readme_slide.jpg)

## SUMMARY

Built as a final project by myself and threee others. A multiplayer running game for iPhone and Android, designed to make exercise fun. It combines the background GPS locating, data visualisation and statistic tracking features of a serious fitness app like Strava with a hexagonal game board, allowing players to claim territory from others in real time simply by going for a run, while constantly working towards achievements to level up.

## TECHNOLOGIES

React Native + Expo
Turf.js
Firebase
Geolib
